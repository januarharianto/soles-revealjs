# About

> Have **more** than you show, speak *less* than you know. 

-- William Shakespeare

## Quarto

A **technical writing** system that produces *reproducible*, *versioned*, and *extensible* documents.

## Styling

[**Pandoc-flavoured Markdown**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for text formatting.

This is **bold** and this _is_ *italic*. And this is `code`. What about a [link](https://quarto.org)? And a footnote[^1]? Perhaps a crossed out text ~~like this~~?


## Paragraphs

> This is a blockquote.

For code, text is formatted according to the language specified in the code block and syntax highlighting is applied.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# This is what code input looks like
helloworld <- function() {
  print("This is what code output looks like!")
}
```


If code produces an output, it is displayed below the code block with no additional formatting.

```{r}
#| echo: false
print("And this is what code output looks like!")
```

[^1]: This is a footnote.
