## Quarto

A **technical writing** system that produces *reproducible*, *versioned*, and *extensible* documents.

![](images/quarto.jpeg)

## Features
Follows the **University of Sydney** brand guidelines in a bare *minimal* way.

### Logos
The Primary logo is used on the title slide (black), and the secondary horizontal logo is used on the other slides.

### Fonts
Body text in *Source Sans Pro*, other text in *Times New Roman*. These are the official alternate fonts to *Apercu Pro* and *Lyon Display* fonts.

### Colours
Colours are used in a *neutral* way using the official University of Sydney colour palette of [**Ochre**]{style="color:#e64626"}, [**Charcoal**]{style="color:#424242"}, [**Heritage Rose**]{style="color:#daa8a2"}, [**Jacaranda**]{style="color:#8f9ec9"} and [**Eucalypt**]{style="color:#71a499"}. No colour is applied to the background, except for code blocks.

# Quick start

## Installation

Quarto is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. See [installation instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).

### Recommendation

I recommend using [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor for Quarto. It is free, open-source, and has a lot of extensions that can be used to enhance the writing experience.

### However...

If you are used to the RSuite editor, you can also use that. In fact, it is perhaps the easiest way to get started with Quarto if you are already familiar with the R environment.


## Markdown


### Flavour

Quarto uses [**Pandoc-flavoured Markdown**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) for text formatting.

### Formatting

**Bold** and *italic*. `Inline code`. What about a [link](https://quarto.org)? And a footnote[^1]? Perhaps a ~~crossed out text~~? We can also use subscript~s~ and superscript^s^.


### Lists

- Lists **must** be preceded by a blank line.
- We can also created nested lists:
  1. This list is ordered.
  2. This list is also nexted.


[^1]: This is a footnote.



# Advanced features

## Reproducible workflows

The advantage of Quarto over traditional slide software is that it allows code and output to be embedded in the document. This means that you can create a document that is **reproducible** and **versioned**.

### Code example 

Using R, we show how to fit a linear regression model and print the model summary:

```{r}
# fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
# print the model summary
summary(model)
```

---

### Code example 2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
# plot a very nice plot based on iris dataset
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_half_open()
```

## Equations

Equations are based on [**LaTeX**](https://www.latex-project.org/) and powered by [**MathJax**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/math.html).

### Inline equations
Inline equations are surrounded by `$`. For example, the equation $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ is a linear regression model.

### Display equations
Display equations are surrounded by `$$`. For example, one way to display the equation for a [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) is:

$$ f(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_n \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi n x}{L} \right) + b_n \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi n x}{L} \right) \right] $$
